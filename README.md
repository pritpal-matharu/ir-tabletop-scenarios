# ir-tabletop-scenarios

Markdown-based incident response tabletop scenarios for enterprise security teams.

## Scenario themes

- Identity compromise and lateral movement.
- Ransomware and destructive attacks.
- Business email compromise (BEC) and fraud.
- Cloud misconfiguration and data exposure.

## Structure

Each scenario folder should include:

- `scenario.md` – storyline, background, and key events.
- `facilitator-guide.md` – objectives, prompts, and evaluation notes.
- `artifacts/` – redacted screenshots, sample logs, or email snippets.

Example folders:

- `scenarios/identity-compromise/`
- `scenarios/ransomware/`
- `scenarios/business-email-compromise/`
- `scenarios/cloud-misconfiguration/`

These templates are vendor-agnostic but can be aligned with Microsoft Sentinel and Defender workflows.
